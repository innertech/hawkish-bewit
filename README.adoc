A loose implementation of https://github.com/mozilla/hawk/blob/main/API.md#single-uri-authorization[Hawk Bewit] in Kotlin multi-platform, supporting JVM, Android, iOS, and JavaScript.

While https://github.com/mozilla/hawk[Hawk] never gained wide traction as an HTTP authentication scheme, we still find common need for an S3-style URI authorization scheme, in which a URI can be:

[loweralpha]
. signed to validate that it has not been tampered with, and
. set to expire.

Hawk bewits serve this purpose well, without re-inventing the wheel.

However, this is a single-purpose library inspired by Hawk, not a full hawk-compatible implementation.
Bewits generated by this library are not compatible with bewits generated by other Hawk-compatible libraries:

* we *do not* implement the header-mode and the `dlg`, `app` and `ext` attributes
* we *do* validate the URL scheme to protect against protocol downgrade attacks
* the hawk version is set to `1a`, not `1` to indicate incompatibility with Hawk

## Use Cases

. Sign resource links, like images, for temporary access from locations that do not support the underlying site auth protocol e.g. clipboards and external applications.

. Sign links sent to users out of band e.g. emails.

. Sign links sent to 3rd parties to easily access some resource for a limited time.

. etc.

## Java Compatibility

Java code should be able to use this implementation as well, but that has not been well tested.
PRs to improve Java compatibility will be accepted.
